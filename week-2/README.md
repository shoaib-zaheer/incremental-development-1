## Lesson Plan

> [Lesson Plan Slides](https://hackyourfuture.be/incremental-development/week-2)

Incrementally develop a simple responsive web page.

### Isolate

Step-by-step collaboration practice for two people on one repository.  Split into pairs within your group and follow these steps:

- [Git Workflow for Two](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/git-workflow-workshop-for-two)

### Integrate

Redo the wireframe you built last week, but with collaboration!

![semantic wireframe](../integrate/wireframe.gif)

1. In groups of 2-3, choose one team member to be the main repository owner.  They will set up the team repo:
    - generate a new repo from the [w3-validation-starter](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/w3-validation-starter)
    - copy-paste [this development strategy](../integrate/development-strategy-collaborative.md) and [this wireframe](../integrate/wireframe.gif)) into the new repo.
    - Divide the development steps between team members:  write each team member's name in their step of the shared development-strategy file
1. Using the same workflow as before break, build a website to match the wireframe in your shared repository. Each team member is responsible for one step (if your group has too many members, you may want to split into two smaller groups )
1. Return to your small group and discuss.
    - What went well? What was challenging?
    - What conflicts did you have? How did you resolve them?
    - Was it clear _exactly_ what code you needed to write?
    - Was it clear _exactly_ what code your team mates needed to write?

#### `app-theme`

> [Code-Along](http://hackyourfuture.be/homework-submission/#projects)

This week's project is to study the [__app-theme__ tutorial from Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlA7dputiNc).

Writing the same code as Mr. Traversy's code is not enough!  You are expected to submit your code from his tutorial in a new repository [generated](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/) from [this starter template](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/w3-validation-template).  Your repository should be named `app-theme` and should be cleanly developed with one branch per step.  It's up to you to write the development strategy!

This week you are also expected to build your project using the [Git Workflow for Two](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/git-workflow-workshop-for-two) you studied in class.  (Minus the collaboration, this week's project is still individual).  For each step in your development strategy, you are expected to:

- develop the step on a new branch locally
- push the new branch to github
- merge the branch to github using a Pull Request in the repository

You will be assessed not only on your live demo, but also on the quality of your code, the correctness of your branches, and the completeness of your repository. Your repository must:

- Be generated from [this starter template](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/w3-validation-template)
- Contain a README describing your project in detail.  Check out these articles to learn more about writing good README's: [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/), [bulldogjob](https://bulldogjob.com/news/449-how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project), [meakaakka](https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3)
- Have one well-named branch per user story. If we check out any branch, it should contain _only_ the code necessary to make that step work. and it should work!
- Have a file called `development-strategy.md` in which you explain how you broke the project into user stories, describe each user story, and describe what code you wrote to implement this user story.
- Have one issue and merged pull request per step in your development strategy

There are two general paths you can take to get this finished repo, neither is better or worse.  And if you find another way go for it!

- __Two-Stepping__: First - follow the tutorial studying the code and understanding the project.  Second - go through the tutorial another time, this time around focusing on using branches to create a finished repository.
- __One-Stepping__: Follow the tutorial once more slowly, carefully building your finished repository as you go.
